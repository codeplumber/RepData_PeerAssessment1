## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
str(activity)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values
### Rows with NAs
```{r}
library(dplyr)
activityWithNa <- filter(activity, is.na(steps) | is.na(date) | is.na(interval))
numberOfRowsWithNa <- dim(activityWithNa)[1]
```
There are `r numberOfRowsWithNa` rows with NA values.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
